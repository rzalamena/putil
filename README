putil - Paste Util
---

This program was designed to easen the upload of 'pastes' to a remote
location.

A classical example of this is the pastebin.com website: people share
piece of code / logs / texts with a reasonably short URL.

Being written in C, and using almost none libraries, this application or
library API could be used in another ways like debugging application or
keeping logs of enviroments with limited resources.
